ðŸ§¹ Clean up unused fixtures across all test domains

Remove 16 unused fixtures from domain fixture files and conftest.py:

Domain fixture cleanup:
- sentences/fixtures.py: Removed 7 unused fixtures (sample_sentence_*, sample_db_sentence_*, multiple_db_sentences)
- verbs/fixtures.py: Removed 4 unused fixtures (sample_verb_data, sample_verb_create, sample_verb_update, sample_conjugation_data)  
- problems/fixtures.py: Removed 5 unused fixtures (sample_problem_data, sample_problem_create, sample_problem, sample_db_problem, multiple_db_problems)

conftest.py cleanup:
- Removed 9 unused/duplicate fixtures including deprecated supabase_db_connection
- Kept only essential shared fixtures: test_supabase_client, sample_db_verb, sample_problem, sample_db_conjugation, sample_conjugation_create, sample_db_sentence

Updated test imports:
- Added proper imports from domain fixtures to verb service and schema tests
- Made verb schema test flexible to work with dynamic fixture data

All 468 tests still passing after cleanup. Fixture architecture now cleaner with clear separation between shared infrastructure fixtures and domain-specific test utilities.
