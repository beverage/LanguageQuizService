ðŸ§¹ Major codebase cleanup and test coverage improvements

## Test Coverage & Reliability Improvements
- Fix verb service test failures and achieve 89% coverage (19 passed, 2 appropriately skipped)
- Fix test_get_verb_by_infinitive_exact_match using UUID-based unique infinitive
- Fix test_get_verb_with_conjugations with correct tense enum values
- Fix test_search_verbs with unique identifiers to avoid database conflicts
- Comprehensive problems service tests added (895+ lines, 80%+ coverage)
- Enhanced API keys test coverage with 598+ lines of comprehensive tests
- Improved test organization and fixture management across domains

## Schema & Type Safety Improvements  
- Remove unused Union imports and modernize to Python 3.10+ union syntax (|)
- Enhanced schema validation and field definitions across all domains
- Improved type annotations and Pydantic model configurations
- Fixed UP007 linting errors for modern union syntax

## Repository & Service Layer Enhancements
- Enhanced error handling and validation in repositories
- Improved service layer reliability and consistency
- Better separation of concerns across service methods
- Enhanced database interaction patterns

## Code Organization & Cleanup
- Reorganized test fixtures by domain (verbs, sentences, problems, api_keys)
- Improved import organization and dependency management
- Enhanced CLI command structure and error handling
- Better configuration management and client initialization

Result: 62 files improved, significantly enhanced test coverage across all domains, modern Python type annotations, and improved codebase maintainability.
